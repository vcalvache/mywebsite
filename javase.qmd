## What is java?

Java was originally developed by James Gosling. It was released in May 1995.

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA).
