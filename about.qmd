Hi! I'm Victor and welcome to my site.

This section it's made with the intentions that you can know me a little bit better.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna to use this only as a resumme. Instead, I'm gonna share things that I think can relate me.

Let's start with something I can not live without it. Music!

We all have a song that, for any reason,  cheers us up. It may remaind you a moment, someone, or maybe only will make you dance.

On my case, i have a very good memories of this song, because i remember watching the video on tv when i was a teenager and made me discover sounds that i've never heard of. And to this day, i'm really into Rock n' Roll thanks to that moment. 

Turn the volume up, and press play!
